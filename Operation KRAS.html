  <h1>Maine 2025</h1>
  <div class="poem">
    In August twenty-five, we’ll ride the northern plane,
    To piney shores and lobster claws — we’re headed up to Maine.
    But guess who’s hopping in the car, with spirit wild and zany?
    It’s Ryan Davy Wavy Phillips — this trip’s about to be insane-y!

    With shades on tight and cooler packed, he’s ready for the scene,
    From Bar Harbor hikes to rocky coasts, and forests lush and green.
    He’ll cannonball in lakes so cold, then warm up by the fire,
    Telling tales of past adventures that never seem to tire.

    We’ll chow on chowder, sip on brews, and dance beneath the stars,
    With Ryan bringing vibes so strong, you'd think we’re rockin' Mars.
    So buckle up, it’s bound to be a memory we’ll keep —
    With Davy Wavy by our side, this trip won’t skip a beat!
